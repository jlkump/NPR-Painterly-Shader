# NPR-Painterly-Shader

## Repo Summary
This contains all the code for my NPR shader in Opengl. 
However, I wasn't sure how to provide all the things necessary for compiliation, 
as the project I was using for reference was fairly large and I was unsure what files
would be important. Also since the reference project is fairly large, I didn't want to
have a unnecessarily bulky repo that would be difficult to navigate, so I've placed all
the important files I coded here. I have placed the files from the reference
project I used in the ref/ folder. Assets contains all the textures and .obj
files I used for the project.

## Project Video Demonstration
Since the code from this repo alone is not enough to compile the project, here's a video
demonstration of the final product:

The project report is provided in the repo. Here's a google drive link just in case:
